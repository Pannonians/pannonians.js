// Practice 8_objects_and_arrays!
// Let's simulate a TODO app!
/**
 * 1. Create a class called Todo
 * 2. It will have two properties: Text and Done. Defaults are "" and false
 * 3. It will have one function: toggleDone. It has to change from false to true and vice versa.
 * 4. Make an empty list of todos
 * 5. Create a todo for each of the lessons we've covered till now (1-8)
 * 6. After creating each of them, add them to the list
 * 7. console.log each of the items in the list in the form of: `${Text}: ${Done ? 'done!' : 'not yet done'}`
 * 8. Now mark first seven as done using the method in the object toggleDone
 * 9. console.log them all again
 * 10. ~OPTIONAL~ Make optional additional Todos in the TodoList
 * 11. Filter and console.log only ones that are done
 * 12. Filter and console.log only ones that are not yet done
 * 13. Commit!
 * 14. Bonus points: Napravite i timestamp kad se koji todo napravio, i kad se koji todo prebacio na true.
